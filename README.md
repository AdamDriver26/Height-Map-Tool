# Height-Map-Tool
 Stochastically generated fractal landscape.

This tool is an attempt to use (partially) random processes to produce a heightmap of a generated landscape.
Due to the randomness the coastline will be measureable at an infinitely small scale (depending on image dimensions) so 
will therefore be fractal in nature.
